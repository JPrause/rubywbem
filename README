RubyWBEM is a pure-Ruby library for performing operations using the WBEM
management protocol. RubyWBEM is mostly a  a direct port of PyWbem,
current as of version 0.5, svn head revision 165

Note that libopenssl-ruby is required to use rubywbem. I have not
included this in the RPM deps, as, on Fedora at least, this is already
included in the base ruby-libs package, which is already required by ruby.


changes from PyWbem:

support url-embedded credentials in parse_url, wbem_request, etc.

basic eql?, hash method definitions for xml objects 
  needs further refinement to check for semantic equality rather than just looking at
  the XML string, and not really tested for types other than
  CIMInstanceName

Created valid_cimtype method which returns true if a value is a valid
  cim type (extends CIMType or is an appropriate native type (such as
  String, etc.)

CIMType changes:
  Since ruby doesn't support true multiple inheritance, CIMType wraps
  the base type value rather than extending it

  Added boolean CIMType (although raw booleans are still supported)
