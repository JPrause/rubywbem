This directory contains the tests for RubyWBEM.

In order to run the tests, xmllint is required (libxml2 package on
Fedora -- possibly libxml2-utils, etc. on other systems). In addition,
the the CIM operations test depends on ruby-password and ruby-termios
(available at http://www.caliban.org/ruby/ruby-password.shtml) 

To run the CIM operations test, the test.mof file must be loaded in to
the repository.  Under Pegasus, this done by setting the
repositoryIsDefaultProvider configuration variable to true.

# cimconfig -s repositoryIsDefaultInstanceProvider=true -p
# cimmof < test.mof

Pegasus must be restarted in order for the change to take effect.
